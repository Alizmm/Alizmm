Hi 👋

I'm an IT and Talent Acquisition Professional with +10 years of work experience in the Software industry 👩🏻‍💻 .

During my career, I've gained deep experience in many SAP full life cycle projects, from proposals to delivery performing all the following responsibilities: Project Manager, Project Leader, Team Leader, Consultant and Analyst.

Although I have a technical profile, I’ve been managing other aspects in the last IT projects I was involved, related to talent planning and staffing. My involvement with different local and remote teams around the world 🌎, has given me a deep knowledge of human resources tasks, which helped me to make a career change🚀 into a new role in Human Resources.

Currently, I’m Talent Acquisition Manager at Neginet and I love what I do💖.
